# 100daysOfCode

## Day 1 - 30-Mar-2020
First day of my HDoC. My plan is to develop a News aggregator using javascript. Initially, I have to set up a proxy server for all my service consumption. Intending to build the frontend using VueJS. 

As a first step, I have set up a ExpressJS application which will consume NewsAPI apis.

Todo: Filter the 'sources' response json to paginate/categorize before sending to client
